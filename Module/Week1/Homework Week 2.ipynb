    "It is said that de Mere had been betting that, in four rolls of a die, at least one six would turn up. He was winning consistently and, to get more people to play, he changed the game to bet that, in 24 rolls of two dice, a pair of sixes would turn up. It is claimed that de Mere lost with 24 and felt that 25 rolls were necessary to make the game favorable. It was un grand scandale that mathematics was wrong."
